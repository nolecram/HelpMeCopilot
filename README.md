## Deploying NGINX on Azure using Terraform

This section details the process of deploying NGINX on Azure using the Terraform configuration file `deploy_nginx_azure.tf`. The Terraform script automates the creation of necessary Azure resources such as Virtual Machines, Networking, and the installation of NGINX. For more information, refer to the `deploy_nginx_azure.tf` file in the repository.

## Deploying a LAMP Stack with NGINX on Azure using Terraform

In addition to deploying NGINX, this repository now supports the deployment of a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack alongside NGINX on Azure using Terraform. This integration enhances the capabilities of your deployment by adding a dynamic, database-driven web application environment to the robustness of NGINX.

To deploy the LAMP stack with NGINX, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Terraform installed and configured for Azure.
2. Clone this repository and navigate to the directory containing the Terraform scripts.
3. Update the `deploy_nginx_azure.tf` script to include the LAMP stack module. This step has been automated in the script, but you can review the configuration for understanding.
4. Run `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform workspace and download necessary providers.
5. Execute `terraform plan` to review the deployment plan and ensure all resources are correctly configured.
6. Apply the deployment by running `terraform apply`. Confirm the action when prompted.
7. Once the deployment is complete, you can access your NGINX server and the LAMP stack applications using the public IP address provided by Azure.

For detailed configuration options and to customize your deployment, refer to the `modules/lamp_stack` directory which contains the Terraform module for the LAMP stack deployment.
