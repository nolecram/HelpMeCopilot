# Ruby Examples

This directory contains various Ruby programming examples demonstrating different concepts and techniques.

## Files

### classesdef.rb
Demonstrates Ruby object-oriented programming concepts:
- **Class Definition**: Shows how to define classes in Ruby (Fred and Barney)
- **Inheritance**: Barney class inherits from Fred class
- **Instance Variables**: Use of @val and @save for object state
- **Methods**: initialize (constructor), getters, setters, and custom operations
- **toString**: Custom to_s method for object representation

**Classes:**
- `Fred` - Base class with value manipulation (set, get, more, less)
- `Barney` - Derived class with backup/restore functionality

### miss-seq.rb
A Ruby script for working with sequences and finding missing elements:
- Sequence analysis and manipulation
- Array operations in Ruby

### regexpr.rb
Regular expression examples in Ruby:
- Pattern matching demonstrations
- String manipulation with regex
- Common regex use cases

### sum2num.rb
Mathematical operations in Ruby:
- Sum calculations
- Basic arithmetic demonstrations

## Purpose

These files serve as practical examples of Ruby programming concepts, useful for:
- Learning Ruby syntax and idioms
- Understanding object-oriented programming in Ruby
- Exploring Ruby's string and numeric operations
- Testing GitHub Copilot's Ruby code generation

## Usage

To run any of these Ruby scripts:

```bash
ruby classesdef.rb
ruby miss-seq.rb
ruby regexpr.rb
ruby sum2num.rb
```

## Prerequisites

- Ruby 2.x or higher installed on your system

## Learning Resources

These examples complement the broader HelpMeCopilot repository's goal of exploring programming concepts across multiple languages.
