## Quick Start

Each subdirectory contains its own README.md with specific instructions for:
- Prerequisites and dependencies
- Installation steps
- Usage examples
- Educational objectives

## Documentation

For detailed information about specific components, refer to:
- Individual README.md files in each subdirectory
- Main repository [README.md](../README.md)
- [docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md](../docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md)

## Contributing

When adding new code:
1. Place it in the appropriate subdirectory
2. Add a README.md if creating a new directory
3. Include inline comments for complex logic
4. Follow existing code style conventions
