# Machine Learning Experiments

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for machine learning experimentation and learning.

## Files

### SampleMLFunction.ipynb
A Jupyter notebook demonstrating machine learning function implementations.

**Topics Covered:**
- Machine learning algorithm implementations
- Data preprocessing techniques
- Model training and evaluation
- Python ML libraries usage

### SampleMLJupyter.ipynb
An interactive Jupyter notebook for hands-on ML experimentation.

**Topics Covered:**
- Data exploration and visualization
- Feature engineering
- Model selection and comparison
- Interactive analysis workflows

## Purpose

These notebooks serve as:
- Educational resources for learning ML concepts
- Experimentation environment for testing algorithms
- Templates for data science projects
- Interactive examples for GitHub Copilot ML code generation

## Prerequisites

### Required Python Packages
```bash
pip install jupyter numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

Optional packages (depending on notebook content):
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras torch
```

## Usage

### Starting Jupyter Notebook

1. Navigate to the ML_Experiments directory:
```bash
cd src/ML_Experiments
```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

3. Open the desired notebook in your browser

### Running the Notebooks

- Click on `SampleMLFunction.ipynb` or `SampleMLJupyter.ipynb`
- Execute cells sequentially using Shift+Enter
- Modify code and re-run cells to experiment

## Notebook Structure

Typical notebook sections include:
1. **Imports and Setup**: Library imports and configuration
2. **Data Loading**: Loading datasets for analysis
3. **Exploration**: Data visualization and statistics
4. **Preprocessing**: Feature scaling, encoding, and transformation
5. **Modeling**: Training and evaluating ML models
6. **Results**: Visualization and interpretation of results

## Best Practices

- Run cells in order to maintain proper state
- Save notebooks frequently
- Clear output before committing to version control
- Document your experiments with markdown cells
- Keep data files separate from notebooks

## Educational Value

These notebooks are ideal for:
- Learning machine learning fundamentals
- Practicing data science workflows
- Testing GitHub Copilot's ML code suggestions
- Building a portfolio of ML projects

## Integration with HelpMeCopilot

These notebooks complement the repository's goal of exploring GitHub Copilot across different domains, specifically in data science and machine learning contexts.

## Note

Notebooks may require specific datasets. Check individual notebook instructions for data requirements and download links.
