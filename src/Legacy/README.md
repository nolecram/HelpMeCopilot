# Legacy Code Examples

This directory contains examples of legacy programming languages and technologies that are still in use in enterprise environments. These examples are useful for:

- Understanding legacy system integration
- Learning older programming paradigms
- Testing GitHub Copilot with legacy languages
- Maintaining compatibility with existing systems

## Subdirectories

### Assembly/
x86 Assembly language examples demonstrating low-level programming.

### C/
C programming examples with POSIX threading and system calls.

### COBOL/
COBOL examples showcasing mainframe programming and Language Environment callable services.

## Purpose

These examples serve as:
- Reference implementations for legacy systems
- Educational resources for learning older technologies
- Test cases for GitHub Copilot's multi-language capabilities
- Bridge between modern and legacy codebases

## Note

These files are maintained for compatibility testing and educational purposes. They represent common patterns found in enterprise legacy systems.
