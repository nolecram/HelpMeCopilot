# Chat Experiments

This directory contains experimental JavaScript code for chat and interactive functionality.

## Files

### Experiment1.js
A recursive sum function implementation that demonstrates:
- Recursive function design for summing numbers from 1 to n
- Multiple variations of the same recursive pattern
- Basic JavaScript testing concepts

**Functions:**
- `sum(num)` - Recursively calculates the sum of integers from 0 to num
- `addRange(num)` - Alternative implementation of recursive sum
- `addRandomNumbers(num)` - Another recursive sum variant

### Experiment2.js
A palindrome checker implementation that demonstrates:
- String manipulation and traversal
- Palindrome detection algorithm
- Basic user input handling

**Functions:**
- `checkPalindrome(string)` - Checks if a string is a palindrome by comparing characters from both ends

## Purpose

These files serve as experimental code for learning and testing JavaScript concepts with GitHub Copilot. They are part of the legacy experimental codebase.

## Usage

To run these experiments:

```bash
node Experiment1.js
node Experiment2.js
```

Note: These are experimental files and may require modifications to run properly.
