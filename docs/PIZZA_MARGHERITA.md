## Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Dough

1. **Activate the yeast:** In a small bowl, combine lukewarm water, yeast, and sugar. Stir gently and let sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy.

2. **Mix the dough:** In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil.

3. **Knead the dough:** Mix with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms, then turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead for 8-10 minutes until the dough is smooth, elastic, and slightly tacky but not sticky.

4. **First rise:** Shape the dough into a ball and place in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover with a damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place for 1.5-2 hours, or until doubled in size.

5. **Divide the dough:** Once risen, punch down the dough and divide it into 4 equal portions. Shape each portion into a smooth ball. Cover and let rest for 15-20 minutes.

### Step 2: Prepare the Sauce

1. **Crush the tomatoes:** Drain the San Marzano tomatoes, reserving a small amount of the juice. Use your hands or a fork to crush the tomatoes into small chunks.

2. **Make the sauce:** In a bowl, combine crushed tomatoes, minced garlic, olive oil, salt, and sugar (if using). Mix well. Do not cook the sauce - it will cook on the pizza.

3. **Add basil:** Tear 2-3 fresh basil leaves and mix into the sauce. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.

### Step 3: Prepare the Mozzarella

1. **Drain the mozzarella:** If using fresh mozzarella packed in water, drain it thoroughly and pat dry with paper towels.

2. **Slice or tear:** Cut the mozzarella into thin slices or tear it into small pieces. Place on paper towels to absorb excess moisture.

### Step 4: Preheat the Oven

1. Place your pizza stone or baking steel on the lowest rack of the oven.

2. Preheat the oven to its highest temperature, typically 500-550°F (260-290°C), for at least 45 minutes before baking. The stone/steel needs to be thoroughly heated.

### Step 5: Shape the Pizza

1. **Flour the surface:** Lightly flour your work surface and your hands.

2. **Flatten the dough:** Take one dough ball and gently press it into a flat disc using your fingertips, leaving a slightly thicker border around the edge for the crust.

3. **Stretch the dough:** Carefully stretch the dough by draping it over your knuckles and gently rotating it, allowing gravity to stretch it. Alternatively, use a rolling pin for a thinner, crispier crust. Aim for a 10-12 inch circle, about ¼ inch thick.

4. **Transfer to peel:** Place the stretched dough on a pizza peel dusted with flour or semolina, or on parchment paper on a flat surface.

### Step 6: Assemble the Pizza

1. **Add sauce:** Spread 3-4 tablespoons of tomato sauce in the center of the dough, using the back of a spoon to spread it in a thin, even layer. Leave a ½-inch border around the edge for the crust.

2. **Add mozzarella:** Distribute the mozzarella pieces evenly over the sauce, avoiding overcrowding. Less is more for an authentic Margherita.

3. **Drizzle olive oil:** Lightly drizzle extra virgin olive oil over the pizza.

4. **Season:** Add a pinch of sea salt.

### Step 7: Bake the Pizza

1. **Transfer to oven:** Carefully slide the pizza (with or without parchment paper) onto the preheated pizza stone. If using parchment, you can remove it halfway through baking for a crispier bottom.

2. **Bake:** Bake for 8-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly. The exact time will depend on your oven temperature and pizza thickness.

3. **Watch carefully:** Keep an eye on the pizza, as it can burn quickly at high temperatures.

### Step 8: Finish and Serve

1. **Remove from oven:** Carefully remove the pizza using the pizza peel or a large spatula.

2. **Add fresh basil:** Immediately top with fresh basil leaves while the pizza is hot.

3. **Final drizzle:** Add a final drizzle of high-quality extra virgin olive oil.

4. **Season:** Add a light sprinkle of sea salt and freshly ground black pepper if desired.

5. **Slice and serve:** Let rest for 1-2 minutes, then slice and serve immediately.

## Tips for Success

### Dough Tips
- **Temperature matters:** Use lukewarm water (not hot) to activate the yeast without killing it.
- **Don't rush the rise:** A slow, cool rise develops better flavor. You can refrigerate the dough overnight after the first rise for enhanced flavor.
- **Proper kneading:** The dough should be elastic and spring back when poked. This develops the gluten structure.
- **Room temperature:** Let dough come to room temperature before shaping for easier handling.

### Sauce Tips
- **Keep it simple:** Traditional Pizza Margherita uses uncooked sauce. The fresh tomato flavor shines through.
- **Quality tomatoes:** San Marzano DOP tomatoes are ideal for their sweet flavor and low acidity.
- **Don't over-sauce:** Too much sauce makes the pizza soggy. Use a light hand.

### Cheese Tips
- **Dry the mozzarella:** Excess moisture from fresh mozzarella can make the pizza soggy. Pat it very dry.
- **Buffalo vs. Fior di latte:** Buffalo mozzarella is traditional and more flavorful, but fior di latte (cow's milk mozzarella) is also authentic and melts beautifully.
- **Don't overdo it:** A Pizza Margherita is not about being loaded with cheese. Use a moderate amount.

### Baking Tips
- **Preheat thoroughly:** A properly preheated pizza stone is essential for a crispy crust.
- **High heat is crucial:** The higher the temperature, the better. Professional pizza ovens reach 800-900°F (425-480°C).
- **Cornmeal or semolina:** Dust your pizza peel with cornmeal or semolina to help the pizza slide off easily.
- **One at a time:** Bake pizzas individually for best results.

### Assembly Tips
- **Less is more:** Don't overload the pizza. Traditional Margherita is simple and balanced.
- **Fresh basil after baking:** Add basil after baking to preserve its fresh flavor and bright color.
- **Work quickly:** Once your dough is shaped and topped, get it in the oven quickly to prevent sogginess.

## Variations

### Neapolitan Style
- Use only San Marzano tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella, fresh basil, and extra virgin olive oil
- Bake at the highest possible temperature for 60-90 seconds (requires a pizza oven)
- Aim for a puffy, slightly charred crust with a soft, chewy center

### New York Style
- Use a slightly higher ratio of water to flour for a crispier crust
- Add a touch of sugar to the dough
- Bake at 500°F for 10-12 minutes

### Margherita with Garlic
- Add thinly sliced fresh garlic to the sauce before baking
- Alternatively, rub a cut garlic clove on the crust after baking

### White Margherita (Pizza Bianca)
- Omit the tomato sauce
- Use ricotta cheese mixed with mozzarella
- Add garlic and fresh herbs

## Storage and Reheating

### Storing Dough
- **Refrigerate:** Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 3 days
- **Freeze:** Wrap each dough ball individually and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw in refrigerator overnight before using.

### Storing Leftover Pizza
- **Refrigerate:** Store in an airtight container for up to 3 days
- **Freeze:** Wrap individual slices in plastic wrap, then aluminum foil. Freeze for up to 2 months.

### Reheating
- **Oven method (best):** Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Place pizza on a baking sheet and heat for 8-10 minutes until warmed through.
- **Skillet method:** Heat a skillet over medium heat, add pizza, cover with a lid, and heat for 3-4 minutes until cheese melts.
- **Avoid microwave:** This makes the crust soggy and chewy.

## History

Pizza Margherita was created in 1889 in Naples, Italy, by pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito. Legend says it was made to honor Queen Margherita of Savoy during her visit to Naples. The pizza was designed to represent the Italian flag with its three colors: red (tomatoes), white (mozzarella), and green (basil). It quickly became one of the most beloved pizzas in the world and remains a symbol of Italian culinary tradition.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use bread flour instead of tipo 00?**  
A: Yes! Bread flour works well and creates a chewier crust. Tipo 00 is preferred for its fine texture and is more traditional.

**Q: Do I need a pizza stone?**  
A: While a pizza stone produces the best results, you can use a preheated heavy baking sheet or even an upside-down baking sheet.

**Q: Can I make the dough ahead?**  
A: Absolutely! The dough can be refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 3 months. Cold fermentation actually improves the flavor.

**Q: Why is my pizza crust not crispy?**  
A: Common causes include: oven not hot enough, pizza stone not preheated long enough, too much sauce, or wet mozzarella. Make sure to address these factors.

**Q: Can I use pre-shredded mozzarella?**  
A: For an authentic Margherita, fresh mozzarella is essential. Pre-shredded cheese contains anti-caking agents and won't melt as well.

**Q: My dough keeps shrinking when I try to stretch it. What am I doing wrong?**  
A: The dough hasn't rested enough. Let it rest at room temperature for 15-20 minutes before stretching to relax the gluten.
